# TM1py-REST-API-update-with-selenium
This was a project I completed while I was attempting to authenticate with the TM1 Rest API. The company I work for has a software sitting on top of the COGNOS server I was trying to contact that would block all API calls. To get around this, I used the web driver Selenium to impersonate myself opening a web browser, and then collected the cookie (a token) and passed it back to the TM1 server to authenticate. This required me to adjust the code within the TM1py RESTService.py script. Specifically, I had to alter the _build_authorization_token function.
